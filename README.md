## Project Background
- In this case study, I am a junior data analyst working for a company called Global Bike Inc. I have been assigned to assist the strategic planning team with profitability analysis in the wholesale division of the company. The internet sales will be handled by a different team. My IT team has pulled transactional data from 2007 through 2011 for me to analyze. 
- Everyone on the team agrees that I am the best person to do the initial exploration of the data set. Although I am free to do my own analysis. The insights from this analysis will be used to report back to the team to offer high quality service and support to the community. 

## Technology Used 
- Tableau Desktop 2021.4
